        <ul>
            <li>The amount of the monthly or other scheduled repayments payable to Lenders in respect of the loans will be set out in the Loan Contract.</li>
            <li>A detailed payment schedule will be provided to you following the Loan Contract is in force (and such information is also available through your account on the platform).</li>
            <li>We will collect the repayment amounts each month or as otherwise set out in the Loan Contract via Post Dated Checks you provided.</li>
        
            <li>  We will collect the repayment amount due, at most 5 days before the date specified in the Loan Contract to ensure that funds are received and distributed to Lenders</li>
   
        <li>The monthly or other scheduled repayments payable due you to each lender may be viewed on your Account Dashboard.</li>

        <li>You may repay an entire loan early at any time, provided you pay the principal amount outstanding, together with the interest due until the end of the month in which the loan is so repaid. A pre-termination fee equivalent to 1-month of interest shall be charged accordingly upon termination</li>
       
        <li>In certain circumstances, Link Coop may (but is not obliged to) enforce certain terms of each Loan Contract on behalf of the Lenders bound to it. In doing so, Link Coop is authorized to act as an agent on behalf of the relevant Lenders (by its agreed terms and conditions with the Lenders) in taking such action. In such a case, you are liable to pay any attorney’s fees, filing fees, and costs if we have to take any legal action before the appropriate courts to enforce these Terms and Conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="mt-3">PAYROLL DEDUCTION OR AUTO-DEBIT ARRANGEMENT FOR INDIVIDUAL BORROWERS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Upon registration, you are given the option to pay your regular loan payments through payroll deductions or auto-debit arrangements.</li>
        <li>You will also be provided with the Irrevocable Authorization and Direction Form (for the employer) and Authority to Deduct Form (for the bank) concerning your scheduled payroll deductions. These documents are provided to you before any loan is made, and you must read and agree to the terms before any loan will be made.</li>
        <li>Upon selection, you shall submit your duly signed Irrevocable Authorization and Direction Form or Authority to Deduct Form to Link Coop, subject to the approval of your employer or bank</li>
        <li>While your employer or bank facilitates repayment through convenient payroll deductions, you are ultimately responsible for repaying your loan after you have severed your employment.</li>
        <li>If for any reason, any two (2) consecutive payments are not made in full, then the payroll deductions will stop. We will then initiate actions provided under the Default section of these Terms and Conditions</li>
        <li>You can avoid default by notifying Link Coop and creating a special repayment method.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="mt-3">DEFAULT</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>f your PDC was not honored by our depository banks, we shall inform you accordingly on the notice of dishonor.</li>
        <li>If you miss a payment or only partially pay the amount due, we (ourselves or through an agent acting on our behalf) will contact you and ask you why you have missed a repayment, and we will attempt to collect the payment.</li>
        <li>We reserve the right to contact you by any method necessary including, but not limited to, by letter, email, phone call, SMS, or by sending private messages to your affiliated social media accounts.</li>
        <li>If our re-attempt to collect the funds fails two (2) days after the payment was due, your account will be treated as an overdue account, and we will continue to attempt to collect the funds. We may refer the missed payment to a debt collections agency (“Collections Agency”), who will attempt to collect the money on the Investors’ behalf.</li>
        <li>If payment still has not been made seven (7) days from the date payment was due, Link Coop shall charge you administration fees up to 1.25% per month of the missed payment amount (Principal + Interest), which would be in addition to the loan sums due. We may also charge other fees to cover our tracing charges, field agents’ costs, litigation costs, expenses, and other such fees and in-house collections charges (if the loan is defaulted or becomes 3 months in arrears) incurred by Link Coop in the course of protecting the interests of the Investors.</li>
        <li>Save exceptional circumstances (such circumstances being deemed exceptional by Link Coop in its absolute discretion from time to time), if you miss, fail to pay, or only partially pay three (3) or more consecutive monthly installments, or if you otherwise fail to comply with any term or condition of the Loan Conditions, the loan will be placed into default and we will issue you with a default notice and termination notice and will pursue you for the total loan amount outstanding, including corresponding penalty charges accrued while being in default. We will give you 17 days’ notice before filing a default on your credit reference file with the credit bureau. Please see our privacy policy for more details on how we disclose information about you.</li>
        <li>If we and/or the Collections Agency is still unable to collect the debt, Investors will assign their loan interests to TITLE SECURE (“Security Holder”) to hold as legal owner on trust for the Investors. Link Coop (as “Security Agent”, acting on behalf of the Security Holder) may take such steps as it considers necessary or desirable to recover the amount owed from you and/or the relevant guarantors, including without limitation to sell the assigned debt to a debt purchaser, instruct third parties to assist with the recovery process, and/or commence formal legal or insolvency action. If such further action is necessary, a collections charge will be added to your debt in addition to any third-party costs (including but not limited to any external legal fees). Such costs and charges will be passed on to you as the defaulting borrower (and are payable immediately). In respect of loans completed on or after 28 September 2015, Investors may not opt-out of assigning their loan parts or whole loans to TITLE SECURE. In respect of loans entered into before this date, Investors can opt-out of the transfer of their loan parts or whole loans to TITLE SECURE but if they do so, they undertake to Link Coop and the borrower (amongst others) in the Terms and Conditions for Investors to act at all times in a fair, transparent and proportionate manner having due regard to the borrower and/or guarantor, and in compliance with all relevant laws, regulations and best practice guidance. For the avoidance of doubt, Link Coop has no liability to you whatsoever for the conduct of Investors in any capacity and is not obliged under any circumstances to enforce the Investor undertaking referred to above.
            It is hereby agreed that time is of the essence about the payment of each monthly repayment. Accordingly, Link Coop shall, upon default the loan, demand immediate payment of the full amount of the loan (with all outstanding accrued interest) plus costs and the collections charges if any repayment is missed or only partially repaid (and such missed repayment is not remedied within 10 business days), or if you (or any guarantor of the loan) enter or is deemed to be likely to enter any formal or informal insolvency process.</li>
